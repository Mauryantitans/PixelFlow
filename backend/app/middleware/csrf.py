"""
CSRF protection middleware (double-submit cookie).

Cookie-based auth is automatically attached by the browser, which makes
state-changing requests forgeable across sites. To prevent that, the SPA reads
the non-httpOnly ``pf_csrf`` cookie and echoes it back in the ``X-CSRF-Token``
header; this middleware rejects unsafe requests whose header doesn't match the
cookie.

Enforcement is scoped so it never affects non-browser clients or the
session-establishing endpoints:
  * only unsafe methods (POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH) under ``/api``,
  * only when an auth cookie is actually present (pure ``Authorization: Bearer``
    API clients are not cookie-driven and therefore not CSRF-able), and
  * never on the endpoints that create the session before a CSRF cookie exists
    (login / register / Google OAuth).

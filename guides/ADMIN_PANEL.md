## 📊 **Admin Panel Overview**

The admin panel has **5 tabs**:

1. **Limits** - Configure user quotas and upload limits
2. **Cleanup** - Manual cleanup tools and statistics
3. **Storage** - View storage usage and session statistics
4. **Retention** - Configure data retention policies
5. **Database** - View/manage users, images, and pipelines (PIN-protected)

---

## 🎛️ **Tab 1: Limits**

Configure system-wide limits and quotas.

### **Pipeline Limits**

**Free User Max Saved Pipelines**
- Default: 3 pipelines
- Range: 1-100
- Controls how many pipelines a free user can save

### **Storage Quotas**

**Guest Users**
- Default: 50 MB
- Range: 10-1000 MB
- Total storage for anonymous users

**Registered Users**
- Default: 500 MB
- Range: 100-10,000 MB
- Total storage for authenticated users

### **Image Upload Limits**

**Guest Max Images/Session**
- Default: 50 images
- Controls total images a guest can upload in one session

**User Max Images/Session**
- Default: 100 images
- Controls total images a registered user can have

**Max Images Per Upload**
- Default: 20 images
- Controls how many images can be uploaded at once

### **Quota Behavior**

**Auto-delete oldest when quota exceeded**
- Default: OFF (recommended)
- When OFF: Shows popup warning, user must delete manually
- When ON: Automatically deletes oldest images (not recommended)

**Warn at Percentage**
- Default: 80%
- Shows warning when user reaches this % of quota

---

## 🧹 **Tab 2: Cleanup**

Manual cleanup tools and statistics.

### **Current Behavior**

**What Gets Cleaned:**
- Expired sessions (> 30 days old)
- Orphaned images (no valid session/user)

**What Doesn't Get Cleaned:**
- Active user images
- Recent uploads (within retention period)
- Saved pipelines (never auto-deleted)

### **Cleanup Statistics**

**Expired Sessions**
- Shows count of sessions older than retention period
- Safe to delete

**Orphaned Images**
- Images with no associated session or user
- Usually from bugs or crashes
- Safe to delete

### **"Run Cleanup Now" Button**

**What it does:**
- Deletes expired sessions
- Removes orphaned images
- Follows retention policies
- Safe maintenance operation

**When to use:**
- Regular database maintenance
- After fixing bugs
- When storage is filling up

---

## 💾 **Tab 3: Storage**

View real-time storage and session statistics.

### **Statistics Cards**

**Uploaded**
- Total count of uploaded images in database

**Processed**
- Total count of processed/result images

**Storage**
- Total disk space used by images (in MB)

**Sessions**
- Active sessions (heartbeat in last 5 minutes)

### **Breakdown**

- Guest images vs User images
- Total users
- Total pipelines

### **Special Tools**

**"Fix Orphaned Images" Button**
- Reassigns guest images to their rightful owners
- Uses session data to find correct user
- Run this if you see high guest image counts

**"Delete ALL Images" Button** ⚠️
- **DANGER ZONE**
- Permanently deletes EVERY image
- Requires typing "DELETE" twice
- Use only for complete reset

---

## ⏰ **Tab 4: Retention**

Configure how long data is kept before auto-cleanup.

### **Upload Retention**

**Guest Uploads**
- Default: 24 hours
- How long to keep guest uploaded images
- Older images auto-deleted by background job

**User Uploads**
- Default: 7 days
- How long to keep authenticated user uploads
- Users can delete manually anytime

### **Processed Image Retention**

**Why shorter?** Processed images can be regenerated from originals, so they don't need long retention.

**Guest Processed**
- Default: 1 hour
- Temporary results for guest users

**User Processed**
- Default: 24 hours
- Results for authenticated users

### **Real-World Retention**

Standard policies:
- Guest images: 24-48 hours
- User images: 30-90 days
- Processed images: 1-7 days
- Sessions: 30 days

**Adjust based on:**
- Available storage
- User expectations
- Legal requirements

## 📈 **Understanding Session Tracking**

### **Active Sessions**

**Definition**: Sessions with heartbeat in last **5 minutes**

**Why 5 minutes?**
- Heartbeat pings every 30 seconds
- 5 minute window allows for network delays
- Standard in real-world applications

**Session Status:**
- 🟢 **Active**: Last heartbeat < 5 min ago
- 🔴 **Inactive**: No heartbeat in > 5 min
- ⏰ **Expired**: Older than retention period (30 days)

### **Session Lifecycle**

```
Create Session → Active (heartbeat) → Inactive (5 min) → Expired (30 days) → Cleaned Up
     ↓              ↓                      ↓                  ↓                  ↓
  User opens    User active          User closed tab      Auto-cleanup      Deleted
  website       in tab               or idle
```

## ⚙️ **Changing Settings**

### **How to Edit**

1. Go to any settings tab (Limits, Retention)
2. **Adjust values** using input fields or toggles
3. **Orange "Unsaved changes"** indicator appears
4. Click **"Save Changes"** (green button)
5. Settings apply immediately

### **Settings Persistence**

- ✅ Saved in database (system_settings table)

- ✅ Tracked with timestamp and admin who changed them

### **Reverting Changes**

**Option 1: Refresh without saving**

- Change values to original
- Click "Save Changes"

---

## 🔄 **Real-Time Updates**

### **Manual Refresh**

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

### **PIN Protection**

**Why?**
- Protects sensitive user data (emails, images)
- Prevents unauthorized database access
- Required for viewing user details

**PIN Requirements:**
- 4-6 digits
- Stored as hashed value (secure)
- Required every time you open Database tab

### **Admin-Only Access**

**Who can access:**
- ✅ Users with `is_admin = True`
- ❌ Regular users (no Admin Tools button)
- ❌ Guest users (no account)

**How to make someone admin:**
```bash
# Via database
python -c "from app.core.database import get_db; from app.models.db_models import User; db = next(get_db()); user = db.query(User).filter(User.email == 'email@example.com').first(); user.is_admin = True; db.commit()"

# Or via SQL
sqlite3 pixelflow.db
UPDATE users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE email = 'email@example.com';
```

## 🔔 **Tips for Admins**

### **1. Set Reasonable Quotas**

Don't set quotas too high:
- Storage fills up quickly
- Higher maintenance costs
- Harder to manage

Don't set too low:
- Users get frustrated
- Limits productivity
- More support requests

**Sweet spot:**
- Guests: 50 MB (10-20 images)
- Users: 500 MB (100-200 images)

### **2. Regular Maintenance**

Set a schedule:
- **Daily**: Quick glance at stats
- **Weekly**: Run manual cleanup
- **Monthly**: Review and adjust policies

### **3. Monitor Growth**

Track:
- New user signups per week
- Storage growth rate
- Popular operations
- Peak usage times

### **4. Communicate Changes**

Before changing quotas:
- Notify users
- Give advance warning
- Explain reasons

---

## 🆘 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Database Full**

**Immediate actions:**
1. Admin Panel → Cleanup → "Run Cleanup Now"
2. Admin Panel → Storage → Check guest_images count
3. If high, click "Fix Orphaned Images"
4. If still full, increase retention periods temporarily
5. Contact users with highest storage usage

### **User Locked Out**

**Problem**: User can't log in

**Check:**
1. Admin Panel → Database → Find user
2. Verify account is active
3. Check if too many failed login attempts
4. Reset password via: `python reset_password.py`

### **Suspicious Activity**

**Problem**: Unusual usage patterns

**Actions:**
1. Check active sessions count (should match expected users)
2. Review upload patterns
3. Check for spam accounts
4. Deactivate suspicious accounts
5. Review security logs
